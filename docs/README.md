# API Accessibility Overview

This document captures a small-scale check of API accessibility from the `public-apis` list.

## Sample Accessibility Check

| API | Status | Note |
| --- | ------ | ---- |
| AdoptAPet | Unreachable | Proxy 403 |
| Axolotl API | Unreachable | Proxy 403 |
| Cat Facts | Unreachable | Proxy 403 |
| Cataas | Unreachable | Proxy 403 |
| TheCatAPI | Unreachable | Proxy 403 |

> **Note:** All sampled APIs returned proxy-related errors. The execution environment restricts outbound network traffic, so broader validation was not possible.

## Design & Feature Outline

- 🧊 **3D Objects Library (coming soon):** Explore APIs through interactive 3D visualizations.
- 📱 **Companion Apps (beta):** Mobile and desktop apps for browsing and testing APIs.
- 🌟 **Premium Features (planned):** Advanced search, favorites, and collaboration tools.
